# 👋 ChatGPT-Prompting for Developers

This project uses OpenAI's API to perform natural language processing tasks. 

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before you can run the project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- An OpenAI API key

## 🛠️ Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
